<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>David and Vera Mace have spent almost forty years making a vital
relationship of their own marriage, and, because of their inherent
sense of purpose, consequently have enriched the lives and marriages
of innumerable persons in some sixty countries around the world.</p>

<p>David Mace's first degree was in science from the University of
London. Earlier family influence led him on to Cambridge University,
a degree in theology, and work in a mission church in the
slums of London. Vera, already in youth work, joined him after
their marriage in the work of the mission church. From that point
on theirs was a partnership which focused on counselling persons in
trouble. Later, a PhD. in sociology for David and a Masters degree
with a thesis on Christian marriage for Vera, moved them into full
time marriage guidance work. (Two children, a war causing forced
separation for a time, and a pacifist stand by David which also made
life more difficult, only strengthened them in their life's purpose.)
Before leaving Britain permanently in 1949, they had set up more
than one hundred marriage guidance centers and achieved their goal
of recognition for the Marriage Guidance Council.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to enumerate specifically here all the
activities of teaching, published writing, training seminars and travels
the Maces have shared. Theirs has been a life of richly varied
experiences and shared responsibilities.</p>

<p>From 1960-67 the Maces served as joint Executive Directors of
the American Association of Marriage Counsellors. At present they
are members of Summit Friends Meeting in New Jersey, currently
living in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where David Mace is Professor
of Family Sociology at the Behavioral Sciences Center, Bowman
Gray School of Medicine. David Mace delivered the 1968 Rufus
Jones Lecture, <i>Marriage As Vocation</i>. This pamphlet and the project
it presents is an outgrowth of that experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p class="spaced">"How important is it that Quakers should have good marriages,
and what should Friends General Conference be doing about it?"
This question was asked at a gathering of ten married couples, all of
them Friends, representing both the U.S. and Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>What brought these couples together was the common bond that
all had been leading marriage enrichment retreats at which six to
eight couples, all with stable marriages, spent an intensive weekend
sharing marital growth around the theme "communications-in-depth
about relationship-in-depth."</p>

<p>The project of which they had been a part dates back to the 1968
Rufus Jones Lecture, <i>Marriage as Vocation</i>.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> The impact of the
Lecture and the weekend following resulted in the Religious Education
Committee of Friends General Conference sponsoring a project
to train couples selected by Yearly Meetings to lead marriage enrichment
programs in their own regions. The first group was trained in
1969, the second in 1971, and, as the majority of them met again
the consensus grew that this project had been sufficiently tested to
provide the basis for a more extensive movement within our fellowship.</p>

<p>A number of concerns emerged that can best be expressed as
questions:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>Do Friends reaffirm their traditional belief in marriage and the
family as the foundation unit of the Meeting?</p>

<p>Do Friends believe that their mission to spread love and peace
in the world begins with the practice of love and peace in their
own primary relationships?</p>

<p>Are our Meetings doing their utmost to make use of modern
knowledge and experience in the preparation for marriage of
those for whom they accept responsibility?</p>

<p>Are our Meetings satisfied with what they are doing for the
care and support of the marriages of their members, and that
divorces that occur could not have been prevented by any
means that lay in their power?</p>

<p>Would Friends in positions of leadership be willing to demonstrate
their support for this project by participating in retreats
at which they can examine with others the potentialities for
growth of their own marriages?</p>

</div>

<p>Those who met at Pendle Hill were not in a position to answer
any of these questions in a definitive way. It is clear that answers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
would vary from one Friend to another and from one Meeting to
another. They felt, however, that it would be appropriate and timely
for these questions to be more widely considered. Moreover, their
own experiences of marital growth, resulting from their sharing with
other married couples, had been so rich and rewarding that they felt
they had "good news" to pass on, and were constrained to do so.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<h2>THE PLAN</h2>

<p>Yearly Meetings throughout the United States were invited to
select with care a married couple for a weekend of training at Pendle
Hill, the Quaker study center near Philadelphia.</p>

<p>During the six months following the training each couple would
have the opportunity to conduct a marriage enrichment retreat
arranged by their Yearly Meeting. Then all the couples would reassemble
at Pendle Hill to share their experiences. The project would
be evaluated, and further action would depend on whatever judgment
was reached.</p>

<p>We two were asked to lead the two training weekends. Our
decision was to begin with an actual retreat for the group of couples
since this experience would, in our judgment, provide the best
training we could give them.</p>

<h2>PREMISES FROM EARLIER EXPERIENCES</h2>

<p>In 1962 Joe and Edith Platt, a Quaker couple who helped run a
retreat center called Kirkridge, invited us to conduct a weekend for
married couples. We were at that time joint Executive Directors of
the American Association of Marriage Counselors, so this was a
challenge we could hardly evade. Although we had been involved in
many lectures and conferences about marriage, and plenty of marriage
counseling, a retreat for married couples was a new venture.
However, we accepted the invitation, conducted the retreat to the
best of our ability, and learned a great deal in the process. There is
no need at this point to go into detail about the procedures we
followed for we improved on them considerably later as we gained
further experience.</p>

<p>The first Kirkridge retreat was successful enough to encourage the
Platts to ask us to come again and again. We then began to receive
other requests as it became known that we were available for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
kind of leadership, most of them being under religious auspices. The
retreats generally began on Friday evening and ended with Sunday
lunch. One, for Methodist ministers and their wives, lasted five days,
and proved to be the inauguration of a nation-wide program now
being run by the United Methodist Church under the title "marriage
communication labs."</p>

<p>These experiences brought us into close touch with many "normal"
married couples. Our practice was to insist that the retreats
were <i>not</i> for couples with problems, but for those who considered
they had satisfactory marriages and wanted to explore their potential
for further growth. As counselors, we had previously dealt only
with marriages in trouble. Now we found that many of these
"normal" couples were settling for relationships that were far short
of their inherent potential. Some exhibited the same self-defeating
interaction patterns which we were accustomed to finding in couples
with "problems"&mdash;but either they had accepted these poor patterns
as inevitable, or the conflicts they caused had not yet reached crisis
proportions.</p>

<p>Matching our observation of these couples with some of the
research findings on marital interaction, we arrived at four important
conclusions:</p>

<p>1. Only a small proportion of marriages came anywhere near to
realizing their full potential. Lederer and Jackson<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> suggest that the
proportion of "stable-satisfactory" marriages in our culture does not
exceed 5-10 percent.</p>

<p>2. Most married couples desire, and hope for, the achievement we
have called "relationship-in-depth." Early in their married life, however,
they find their growth together blocked by interpersonal conflicts
which they either cannot understand or are not prepared to
make the effort to resolve. They settle for a series of compromises,
resulting in a superficial relationship.</p>

<p>3. As time passes, the couple either accepts this unsatisfactory
situation, or it becomes progressively intolerable. They are usually so
"locked into" their self-defeating interaction pattern that they are
quite unable to change it by their own unaided efforts. Some seek
marriage counseling, but often too late for it to be effective.</p>

<p>4. This tragedy of undeveloped potential could be avoided in
many instances if married couples had a clearer concept of the task
of marriage and did not have to struggle in almost total isolation
from other couples going through the same experiences. The poten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>tial
of married couples for giving each other mutual help and support
is very great; but it is unable to function because of an unrecognized
taboo in our culture.</p>

<p>This taboo, hitherto unrecognized as such, prevents married couples
from sharing their intramarital experiences with other couples.
In many settings married couples form friendships with each other,
enjoy social contacts, even work together on projects; but there is
always a tacit understanding that they do not reveal to each other,
further than is unavoidable, what is going on in their husband-wife
relationships. Complex mechanisms for evasion and mutual defense
exist. Some of these are familiar, strong hostility in one partner
when the other appears to be revealing too much; making jokes to
relieve tension when some inner secret of the marriage accidently
breaks to the surface; silence or withdrawal when "outsiders" appear
to be probing too deeply. These defense systems work so well that it
is not unusual when a couple begins divorce proceedings for others
in their circle of acquaintance to express astonishment in such terms
as "We are amazed! We had no idea that they were having trouble!"</p>

<p>We could speculate about the reasons for this taboo: a protection
against public humiliation, since we all want others to feel that we
can manage competently such a basic undertaking as marriage; a
safeguard against exploitation, since a discontented marriage partner
offers fair game to a predatory third person; a link with our sexual
taboos, since difficulties in marital adjustment often have a sexual
component, and any suggestion of sexual incompetence is deeply
wounding to our pride. It could reflect the traditional tendency to
regard the family as a closed "in-group"&mdash;an attitude not without
advantages for its strength and stability.</p>

<p>What we are concerned about, however, is that this taboo is being
maintained with a strictness that goes far beyond its usefulness in
our changing society. It is depriving married couples of help and
support from each other, at a time when marriage has become much
more difficult and demanding than it was in the past. Indeed, we
believe that with the emergence of the nuclear family as the norm in
our Western culture, the individual marriage has been deprived of the
supports derived from the extended family of the past precisely at a
time when our rising expectations of highly rewarding interpersonal
relationships are subjecting it to demands it is often unable to meet.
In the larger family groupings of the Orient, despite their hierarchical
structure, a great deal of help and support can become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
available to the individual couple in times of trouble from those with
whom they share a common corporate life.</p>

<p>It may well be that the new "life styles" being experimented with
today&mdash;mate-swapping, multilateral marriages, and group marriages,
for example&mdash;represent attempts to enable the individual marriage
to break out of its isolation and to gain better communication,
interaction and needed support from other marital units.</p>

<p>A striking illustration of this trend toward deep sharing between
married couples has come to our notice from an unexpected quarter.
Two married couples from a conservative Christian background
decided to meet and talk together, with complete detailed frankness,
about their sexual experiences. A series of such meetings was held,
the conversations taped, and subsequently published in book form.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
The couples, after careful consideration, decided not to hide behind
a cloak of anonymity, but to use their real names and disclose their
identity.</p>

<p>Confronted with this new trend, we take the view that
the taboo against the sharing of husband-wife experiences between
one married couple and other married couples can with
impunity be relaxed in appropriate situations with benefit to all
concerned. Between such couples the development of great warmth,
empathy, mutual understanding and support, can contribute significantly
to the enrichment and growth of the individual marriages
involved. This is essentially what happens in marriage enrichment
retreats.</p>

<h2>COMPARISON WITH THERAPY AND ENCOUNTER GROUPS</h2>

<p>"How do our marriage enrichment groups differ from group
marital therapy on the one hand, and from encounter groups on the
other?" These questions are raised by many people. What are the
answers?</p>

<p>Group therapy for married couples is now widely available, and
its effectiveness has been established. Our marriage enrichment
groups differ from therapy groups in three important respects.</p>

<p>First, marital therapy is undertaken with couples who have serious
problems, often because the individuals concerned suffer from
personality disorders. When marriages are not stable a good deal of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>pathology may emerge in the course of group interaction. Severe
conflict between husband and wife may have to be permitted to
surface and be handled openly by the therapist.</p>

<p>The second important difference is that therapy groups generally
continue meeting, on a weekly or bi-weekly basis, over a long period
of time&mdash;as long as a year in some cases. Moreover, individual
couples may also undergo counseling (individually, conjointly, or
both) in association with the group therapy either before being
admitted to the group or concurrently with the group experience.</p>

<p>The third difference is in the leadership pattern. Therapy groups
are led by professionally qualified persons&mdash;psychiatrists, clinical
psychologists, social workers, marriage counselors. They play a fairly
directive role. The leaders are often male and female co-therapists,
but are seldom husband and wife. The role model aspect of the
enrichment group, as well as the participatory aspect, are therefore
much less pronounced and the group is less free to find and follow
its own direction.</p>

<p>An enrichment group consists of several married couples not in
need of therapy meeting on an intensive basis but for a limited time
period. In our opinion such groups need not be led by professional
therapists; although, other things being equal, that is of course a
decided advantage. We have come to the conclusion, however, that
effective leadership can be given by lay couples if they are carefully
selected and trained.</p>

<p>The encounter group, a general descriptive term, is intended to
include many variants. We have participated in such groups, studied
their procedures, and adapted some of these to our marriage enrichment
retreats. Couples who have been involved in encounter groups
adjust quickly and easily to the methods we use in marriage enrichment,
are generally very cooperative, and an asset to our groups.</p>

<p>There are two significant respects in which our marriage enrichment
retreats differ from encounter groups. First, encounter groups
are composed of individuals, while our groups are confined to, and
led by, married couples. This distinction calls for different approaches.
There is a greater complexity in the leadership, and a
greater complexity in the group itself. The encounter group is
confined to interactions between separate individuals and usually
these individuals have not known each other before joining the
group and probably will not continue association afterwards. By
contrast, we have at least three kinds of interaction: between indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>viduals
within the group, between couples (including the leading
couple) within the group, and between husband and wife within the
marital unit.</p>

<p>This multidimensional aspect of the enrichment group not only
makes it more complex, but also increases its potential. This is
particularly true after the experience is over. From our knowledge of
encounter groups we are aware of the problems encountered by the
individual who, after experiencing a new and invigorating openness
and warmth in interaction with others returns home to an atmosphere
in which a similar quality of relationship cannot be sustained
unless there are already friends and associates at home who have had
the benefit of earlier encounter experiences. In the case of our
marriage enrichment retreats, the experience is not gained by an
isolated individual, but by a preexisting social unit, so that new
levels of openness and warmth which the couple have experienced in
the group can continue to be maintained after their return home.
This would suggest that the "casualty rates" for couples would not
be nearly so high as for individuals. We know of no precise study
that has investigated this, but our general impressions would seem to
confirm it.</p>

<p>The second significant difference between encounter and marriage
enrichment groups raises a somewhat controversial question.
Encounter groups are more ready to evoke negative interaction
between participants, while we place major emphasis upon positive
interaction.</p>

<p>If our judgment of encounter groups is in this respect inaccurate
we are open to correction. We have, however, gained the impression
from many sources that an important technique used in these groups
is to provide opportunities for the participants to secure cathartic
release of their pent-up hostilities, including hostilities engendered
by, or projected upon the group leader or one or more of its
members. We recognize that many people in our culture are pregnant
with suppressed hostility or rage, and that the provision of properly
controlled opportunities for its release may constitute a commendable
service; and since the group members are generally
strangers who will not be personally and socially involved later, no
entangling complications are likely to follow.</p>

<p>For our married couples, the situation is different. We do not
mean that they do not have hostile feelings toward each other. They
often do, and this comes out clearly and unmistakably. We do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
mean, either, that healthy discharge of these feelings might not be
good for them&mdash;in our therapeutic work with individual couples in
conjoint interviews, we make full use of such controlled opportunity
for cathartic release with ensuing interpretation. It is our considered
opinion, however, that in the particular context of our enrichment
retreats, unrestrained discharge of hostile feelings should in general
not be encouraged.</p>

<p>Our reasons? One, the shortness of the available time might not
permit the proper resolution of such episodes. Two, a couple who
have openly discharged rage against each other may well react later
with deep feelings of humiliation that are not easily assuaged. Three,
coping with this kind of explosive emotional discharge could be
alarming for lay leaders not accustomed, as the therapist is, to the
expression of deep feelings which normally are not displayed in
public. Four, other members of the group could be similarly disturbed
and diverted from full participation in the main purpose of
the retreat. This complaint has actually been made, and we think
justly, by participating couples in a group where a violent and
prolonged emotional episode took place.</p>

<p>We have been criticized for taking this position, but have not
been persuaded to change our considered opinion. That opinion is
reinforced by another conclusion, namely, that when genuine positive
interaction is promoted, negative emotion, even when it is
strong and intense, tends to dissolve and wither away. Couples have
told us how their fierce hate melted in the atmosphere of warm and
loving support engendered in the group, and with the stirring of
compassion within them, they began to see each other in a new light.
We are inclined to the view, after hearing such testimonies, that in
deploying our therapeutic armament we have given short shrift to
the power of love not only to cast out fear, but also to turn away
wrath.</p>

<h2>LAY LEADERSHIP</h2>

<p>Our decision to train lay couples for leadership was not hastily
made. In fact in the early years during which we were leading
retreats we knew of no other couples who were doing so. After seven
years we felt that we knew what we were doing. Although we
expected criticism from some of our professional colleagues this has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
not developed to any significant degree, and we are now entirely
satisfied that we were justified in taking such a calculated risk. We
know of no case where our lay couples have encountered crisis
situations which they were unable to handle with wisdom and skill.</p>

<h2>STRUCTURING THE RETREAT</h2>

<p>These retreats require a minimum of organization and structure,
but that minimum must be firmly insisted upon. We strongly favor
the residential weekend retreat, although we have met with groups
of couples for separate evening sessions spaced out over four to six
weeks. This approach was found to be less effective, but decidedly
better than nothing for couples who cannot get away from their
homes.</p>

<p>We would regard five or six couples as the optimum number, but
seldom have we enjoyed this luxury. Usually we have had to accept
our upper limit of nine couples, in addition to ourselves, making a
total group of twenty. Often more couples apply than we can take,
and the organizers plead with us to accept the maximum number
because family crises can compel couples to drop out at the last
moment. Two couples short at a retreat planned for five couples
would leave only three. Therefore our normal procedure has been to
ask for six to eight couples.</p>

<p>Although the selection of the couples has been left to the organizers
we insist that husband and wife both undertake to come
together, which means that if one has to drop out, both do so; we
insist that they come only on condition that they both continuously
participate in the entire retreat, from beginning to end.</p>

<p>No requirements regarding age, race, vocation, education, or
socio-economic status are made. There are advantages in having a
homogeneous group of couples, but there are also advantages in a
heterogenous group. Our groups have included one engaged couple
and one honeymooning couple who came straight from their wedding
as well as couples old enough to be retired. They have included
highly qualified professionals and blue-collar workers, PhD.s. and
high school drop-outs.</p>

<p>Couples coming to our retreats should have what they consider to
be reasonably good and stable marriages since our purpose is not to
provide group therapy, but to foster marital growth. The reason for
this requirement is that we do not believe that group marital therapy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
can be attempted on a short-term basis, and it is not the purpose in
these retreats. Many couples come to these retreats with a good deal
of apprehension, and some have told us that they would not have
come at all had they not been assured that it was definitely not for
"problem couples." Despite all our efforts, couples with severe
marital problems do get in occasionally under the wire and we found
no way of avoiding this.</p>

<p>We are often asked to provide preparatory material for the
participants, including books to read, but we do not think there is
any way to "prepare" for this kind of experience; and recommending
books to read might convey the impression that we are
going to engage in intellectual discussion, which is not the case.</p>

<p>We ourselves do not "prepare" for the retreats and do not ask the
couples to do so either. It is an adventure in sharing into which we
all move together, ready to take it as it comes.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>This does not mean, however, that our sessions are totally "unstructured."
A timetable is worked out by the group, not imposed
upon it. Obviously it has to be planned in relation to the place and
the circumstances of our meeting.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION TO THE FRIENDS' EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p>In the living room of "Waysmeet," the house at Pendle Hill in
which we held our first training retreat, there was just room for ten
couples to sit in a wide circle.</p>

<p>"What we are going to do here," we explained, "is to experience
together a marriage enrichment retreat. We hope this experience will
be meaningful to you all personally, quite apart from the fact that
you will be learning how to conduct a retreat yourselves after you
return home. We know of no better way to train you than to let you
go through first what others will later go through under your
leadership.</p>

<p>"However, we shall be working together at two levels. At any
point we can break off and examine together, objectively, what has
been happening to us subjectively. You can ask us as your leaders
any questions you wish, about what we are doing, or why we are
doing it.</p>

<p>"Our goal is very simple and very clear. As married couples we
are here to engage together in communication-in-depth about relationship-in-depth.
Everything we do will be done with the inten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>tion of sharing with each
other the directions in which we want our
marriages to grow. How far we travel will be decided not by us as
leaders, but by you as a group. No one will be put under pressure to
do anything he does not wish to do, or to say anything he does not
wish to say.</p>

<p>"Our function as leaders is to be 'participant facilitators.' We are
in every sense members of the group, and will fully share all the
group's experiences. We do not wish to be treated as experts or
authorities. The only way in which we shall exercise our role as
leaders is to help the group to achieve its goal, or to tell it if we
think it is not taking the best direction toward that goal. We make
no claim to be infallible. If at any point you don't agree with us, it is
your duty to say so. If in any situation we don't know what to do
next we shall say so frankly and ask you to help us.</p>

<p>"Now we are ready to begin. The first thing we must do is to get
to know each other as couples. The sooner we get well acquainted,
the faster we can move toward our goal."</p>

<p>Most of the first evening is devoted to the process of getting to
know each other. Our favorite method is to ask the couples to
volunteer in turn to be freely questioned by the group. We usually
volunteer first, and make it clear that we are prepared to answer the
most personal questions. We indicate at this point that we would like
to be called by our first names, and we hope the others will agree to
do the same. The questions then begin, and when there are no more,
we ask another couple to volunteer. We prefer not to go round the
circle in order, or take names alphabetically. Everything is done
voluntarily as far as possible, to encourage spontaneity.</p>

<p>Time goes quickly as the questions come thick and fast, and it is
usually necessary to limit the questioning, or to ask for brief answers.
It should be emphasized that the participants are free at any
time to ask each other personal questions; this understanding creates
a climate of openness which emphasizes the goal of communication-in-depth.</p>

<h2>THE GROUP IN ACTION</h2>

<p>Assembled again on Saturday morning, we begin by preparing our
"rolling agenda," as one of the trainee couples called it, in order to
keep a record of what the group members want to talk about. The
aspects of marriage they want to include for discussion before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
weekend is over gives us clues to the issues that are important to
them. The list with which one of our trainee couples started their
retreat was:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p>What is the state of our marriage now? How have things
changed as our relationship has grown?</p>

<p>What are the memorable experiences in our lives that have
enriched our marriage?</p>

<p>What have we found to be the most effective ways of handling
conflict?</p>

<p>What do we feel about a depth relationship between one of us
and another person outside the marriage?</p>

<p>Have we found ways of sharing that have contributed to our
spiritual growth?</p>

</div>

<p>We ask the group members if they have any "concerns" explaining
that if members of the group feel unhappy, or anxious, or angry,
about anything that has happened, they have a duty to share their
feelings with us all otherwise the fellowship will be broken. Situations
have occurred in which someone had a concern that another
member of the group also had and neither was expressing.</p>

<p>As a group cannot function effectively without openness to each
other on the part of its members, neither can a marriage grow
without the same kind of openness between its partners. This is what
every married couple should be doing every day&mdash;raising issues that
need to be discussed, and being honest about disturbed or negative
feelings.</p>

<p>There is a sequence of events that is typical of most retreats.
Nearly always, we begin with general discussion of some aspect of
married life. At this stage we are testing each other, so we take
refuge in generalizations. A common theme is the difficulties of
raising children. We can all commiserate with each other about the
problems of the generation gap for it is "safer" to talk about
parenthood than about marriage. If the talk <i>does</i> focus on marriage,
such topics as working wives or overworked husbands or the sharing
of household tasks can be discussed without risk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>The group will move at its own pace from the superficial testing
stage to the deeper sharing. The leaders can facilitate this process,
but it isn't helpful if they try to hurry it. "Personalizing" the
discussion by using such questions as "Mary, did you raise that
subject because it's an issue between you and Tom?" or "I wonder if
any couple could give us an example from their own experience of
what Harold has been talking about?" is helpful.</p>

<p>Once a couple have shared some situation in their own relationship,
one of the leaders can ask "Did any of the rest of you identify
with Peg and Larry as they were talking?" This will help other
couples to share rather than discuss, and move the communication
to a deeper level. A phrase we often use is "making yourself
vulnerable"&mdash;an act of trust by sharing a problem about which the
couple feels some embarrassment. The group's response to this is
invariably warm and supportive with an effort to help by sharing
similar problems which others have experienced or are experiencing.
Sometimes a major breakthrough is achieved when the <i>leaders</i> are
willing to be vulnerable.</p>

<p>This process of deep sharing must not be seen as an orgy of
humiliating confessions. Not at all. The areas where the growth of a
marriage is blocked are almost always sensitive ones which we tend
to keep hidden because they make us feel inadequate or defeated. It
may well be that a way out is not really difficult to achieve, but as
long as we are avoiding the whole problem we are not likely to find a
solution. Bringing the issue out in the open, in the presence of other
couples eager to help because of similar problems may suddenly
break the log-jam and move the relationship along the path to
enrichment. This happens quite often during retreats, and the results
are usually decisive and lasting. The resolution may come for a
particular couple when they are alone together later reporting it to
the others; or it may actually come in the supportive atmosphere
that the group is able to generate. Such experiences are deeply
reassuring and rewarding for all the participating couples.</p>

<h2>FACILITATING EXERCISES</h2>

<p>The use of simple "exercises" in these retreats has been found to
be very helpful. What they do is to break up our stereotyped and
often rather sterile patterns of interaction when people get together.
They are simply devices designed to bring about <i>couple</i> interaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&mdash;sometimes
for all the couples in the group together, sometimes for
one couple at a time.</p>

<p>A good example is asking each couple to draw a picture of their
marriage. Paper and crayons are made available, and the couples
scatter about the room and work on their pictures. They may choose
to do this verbally (discussing the drawing together as they go along)
or non-verbally (working at it together in silence). When all have
finished, we come back to the circle of chairs, and each couple in
turn lays their picture on the floor and explains it to the group. This
is an activity the couples always seem to enjoy; and it enables us to
learn a good deal about each other. The leaders, of course, also draw
their picture, and display it with the others. We have accumulated
quite a collection!</p>

<p>One of our trainee couples introduced dancing. Lights are
dimmed in the room, a record is played, and all the couples dance,
each couple improvising whatever movements express their mood.
They then sit round and report on what the experiment meant to
them.</p>

<p>Occasionally when we are faced with a controversial subject (for
example, "How far are you prepared to allow your partner to go in
friendships with the opposite sex?"), we might ask all the couples to
discuss this privately together for ten minutes, and then report to
the whole group what conclusions they have reached.</p>

<p>Another kind of exercise is what we call "dialogues." A volunteer
couple sit in the center on chairs or on the floor facing each other,
and talk back and forth on a subject chosen by the group but
accepted by them. Some topics have been "How do we deal with
conflict in our marriage?"; "How do we overcome fears of intimacy?";
"What are our procedures in decision-making?"; "How do
we meet each other's dependency needs?" The subject should of
course focus on husband-wife interaction.</p>

<p>It is best for the interchange between the couple to be slow and
deliberate. Indeed, it is helpful for each to allow a period of silence
before replying to the other (learning to pause in this way is a very
helpful means of making husband-wife discussions more effective).
Sometimes two or three couples may volunteer; all sit in the center
of the circle (the "fishbowl," as it is sometimes called) and the
dialogue is taken up by each in turn. While the dialogue is going on,
other members of the group should not intervene or in any way act
as an "audience." The general discussion comes afterwards, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
provides an opportunity for others who identified with the couples
in dialogue to share what they felt.</p>

<p>An interesting variant is to ask if another couple will volunteer to
sit with the couple involved in dialogue, and to function as <i>alter egos</i>
(Latin for "other selves"). The <i>alter ego</i> on each side listens carefully
to what is going on, and intervenes from time to time to verbalize
deeper levels of communication and interaction that are not being
expressed in words. Playing the <i>alter ego</i> role requires some insight
and skill, but it is highly effective when well done.</p>

<p>Another exercise for individual couples is "positive interaction."
A very simple device, it is usually highly effective and often deeply
moving. For this reason we often make it the last activity on
Saturday evening. It can either be carried out by about three
volunteer couples, or all couples may agree to take turns. The couple
sit facing each other, holding hands, and are asked to tell each other,
simply and directly, what they specially like about each other, being
as specific as possible. Surprisingly, it turns out that very few
couples have ever done this before, and everyone finds it a heartwarming
experience. We think we have encountered here another
taboo in our society&mdash;married couples spend infinitely more time
telling each other what they <i>don't</i> like about each other than what
they <i>do</i> like. Most of us have a strangely inhibited self-consciousness
about spelling out in detail what we mean by "I love you."</p>

<p>We generally conclude the retreat with a short session of perhaps
half an hour in which we share with each other new insights and the
rewarding experiences we have had together. This may appropriately
be followed by a Quaker meeting for worship.</p>

<p>These exercises are no more than illustrations. Leading couples
are inventing new ones all the time, and there seems to be no limit to
their ingenuity. The books by Herbert Otto and Gerald Smith, listed
in the bibliography, are full of good ideas.</p>

<p>In essence, these were the experiences in which we and our nine
trainee couples were involved during the crowded hours we spent
together at Pendle Hill. Before they took their departure, we enjoined
them not to try to repeat anything we had done unless they
could do so entirely naturally and comfortably. They would develop
their own patterns of leadership, and these would be more effective
than anything we had taught them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>EVALUATION AND REAFFIRMATION</h2>

<p>The follow-up retreat at Pendle Hill was much more than a
reunion or season of rejoicing. We undertook together an intensive
evaluation of what had been experienced. One couple, for example,
had had to cope with a marriage in serious conflict so we set up a
role-playing re-enactment of the situation to serve as a learning
experience for the whole group.</p>

<p>We also tried to pool our ideas about the best way to plan and
lead marriage enrichment retreats. Our agenda covered the following
areas:</p>

<div class="quote">

<p><i>Organizing the Retreat.</i> Time, place, cost, recruitment of couples,
size of group, preparatory materials.</p>

<p><i>Methods and Techniques.</i> Introductions, agenda, directing discussion,
dividing up, special exercises, crisis situations, evaluation.</p>

<p><i>Leadership Roles.</i> Qualifications, goals, training, couple teamwork,
preparation, vulnerability, follow-up.</p>

<p><i>Future Plans.</i> Further retreats, training new leaders, cooperation
with other groups, books and materials.</p>

<p><i>Other Areas for Enrichment.</i> Retreats for youth, premarital
couples, parents and teen-agers, solo parents, senior citizens,
Meeting members.</p>

</div>

<p>A number of issues of particular concern to the group were
extensively discussed. One was the distinction between our retreats
and group marriage counseling on the one hand, sensitivity training
and encounter groups on the other. Another issue concerned our
emphasis on positive interaction, and the discouragement, though
not avoidance, of overt expression of negative feelings between
members of the group. We also discussed what causes marriages to
get "stuck" so that they cease to grow. This led us naturally to
consider the limitations of lay leaders without training in marriage
counseling, and how to make effective referrals to professionals
when this seems to be indicated. We also talked about the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
silence, so natural to Friends, and how far non-Quakers could accept
this.</p>

<p>In all our discussions we were looking forward. There was a
confident assurance that we had found something of great importance
that must be communicated to others&mdash;to the Society of
Friends generally, but to the wider world as well.</p>

<h2>THE SECOND ROUND</h2>

<p>Another training program was organized and a second group of
couples were invited to Pendle Hill. On a Friday evening in November
1971, therefore, another wide circle of married couples assembled
in the familiar living room at Pendle Hill; later went forth to
conduct retreats arranged by their Yearly Meetings; and returned
triumphantly in April 1972 to report to one another what had
happened.</p>

<p>Six of these couples were new. With them we invited two experienced
couples from the first group of trainees. Our idea was that
they might help in the training of the other six, and be ready then to
graduate as trainers in later regional programs.</p>

<p>We have used this method in training couples before, encouraging
a couple conducting a retreat for the first time to team up with
another trained couple, each supporting and helping the other in
shared leadership. This is a good learning process; and now we were
applying it at the level of training potential leaders, in the expectation
of making ourselves dispensable. A movement of this kind
should not be allowed to focus on personalities. It will prosper best
by involving many couples in a broad sharing of leadership responsibility.</p>

<p>We might have asked ourselves whether what had happened in
1969-70 could happen again in 1971-72. Would the high caliber of the
earlier group of couples be sustained? Would they again learn quickly
enough through the experience of one retreat to function as
successful leaders? Would they come back with the same enthusiasm
and delight? The answers to these questions would do a great deal to
validate the plan we had adopted.</p>

<p>When our couples returned in April 1972, the answers were
resoundingly in the affirmative. In one case, it was true, the local
arrangements had broken down and they had not had the opportunity
yet to conduct a retreat&mdash;but they came to the reunion just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the same. (Their opportunity for leadership came later.) Reports
from all the others, including the two "veteran" couples, had the
same authentic ring of success that had been sounded so unmistakably
a year earlier.</p>

<p>Quoting from the group:</p>

<p>"We felt our job was to provide some structure to help the
experience develop, and then let people sort it out for themselves.
Both of us felt it was most important to ride with the tone of the
developing situation, and avoid any use of the more aggressive
techniques of confrontation. Stan was worried on Saturday that the
talk was too general. Then one of the wives broke through by asking
if we could discuss something "... down here, where I am ... like
SEX?" So we got there ..."</p>

<p>"We viewed our task as leaders to be one of creating and sustaining
an atmosphere in which each couple could speak personally
concerning their marriage. We felt we best accomplished this task
when we participated as a couple in the same way as we urged the
others to participate."</p>

<p>"We regarded ourselves as facilitators. We tried to be creative
listeners; to put questions to the group that would help them to
share personal experiences; to bring about a change of pace when we
sensed this to be necessary."</p>

<p>"We were quite relaxed. We tried to be perceptive of the needs of
individual couples. We hope we didn't talk too much."</p>

<p>"We saw ourselves as equal participants with the others, and
facilitators of a process which started well with frank, meaningful
conversation. We did agenda-building at several points. Our aim was
to create an atmosphere in which defensiveness could be replaced
with tolerant acceptance, and trust and confidence could grow as we
heard each other and learned from each other."</p>

<h2>THE PROBLEM OF UNFELT NEED</h2>

<p>"The underlying problem is the fact that the marriage enrichment
retreat meets unfelt needs. People don't feel keenly that they need
it. If you think your marriage is sound, you aren't strongly motivated
to spend a weekend making it even sounder. To get the tingle
of a potential deepening and enriching takes emotional impact. This
means hearing from someone obviously sensible who is warmly
convinced about it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>A number of theories were developed to explain this resistance to
our project. In general, it is true that it takes <i>problems</i> to motivate
married couples to seek help, just as it takes pain to induce many
people to visit a doctor; and in both cases, action may prove to be
too late to be effective. On the other hand, many couples with
basically stable marriages are wistfully aware that their relationship
falls short of their expectations. But it takes a strong stimulus, in the
form of a cordial personal invitation, to get them to take the
necessary steps to enroll for a retreat.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause of this reticence, expressing itself on occasions
as resistance, it seems an inappropriate response to the needs
and opportunities of our day and age and one of the many factors
responsible for the alienation between young and old which is
popularly termed the "generation gap." Our trainees were themselves
mainly in the second half of life, and they well understood the
"privatism" that is a legacy of our past. They themselves, however,
had lost nothing, and gained a great deal by the efforts they had made
to cultivate greater openness to others, both in their marriages and in
their wider relationships, and they would lovingly invite other
Friends to make the same venture. They would also plead with
Friends to give stronger support to, and undertake more active
participation in, a project to provide marriage enrichment retreats
for the couples in the care of our Meetings.</p>

<p>Some views were expressed suggesting a special reticence among
Friends. There seemed to be some foundation for two theories&mdash;first,
that Quakers tend to be very heavily involved in social projects,
sometimes to the neglect of their own family relationships; and
second, that they tend to be somewhat puritanical in the sense that
they consider it improper to open their private lives to others. There
may be a deep dichotomy in attitudes of Friends here such as
reported by one couple: "vivid impressions of honest encounters
between those who regard the worship of God as a private affair, and
those who feel the need to reach out to their Meeting community
for personal support and a sense of communion which includes
closer relationships with other Friends."</p>

<p>Like other Friends, we are finding that these experiences can
release hitherto unrealized and untapped resources of spiritual
strength and power. As expressed by one couple: "For two years we
passed through a dark time in our family, trying to find resources to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
deal with a seemingly insurmountable problem. At our first retreat,
with the loving support of the group, we were able as a couple to
recover our self-confidence, sense of worth, and well-being, and
reaffirm our strengths to each other.</p>

<p>"The family problem has now been happily resolved, and we have
found extra strength to participate fully in the expression of our
Quaker concerns in the larger community. Our Meeting did much to
sustain us through the bleakest times, and bring us back into clearness
and light; but what helped us the most to help ourselves was our
activities with the marriage enrichment project. We continue to
nurture at home the new openness and depth we have discovered,
and have committed ourselves to maintain the healthy growth that
has been made possible for us."</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

<p>What has been described in this booklet could easily be dismissed
as a new fad that will gain limited attention for a short time and
then be forgotten, but it may instead be the discovery of vast
untapped resources that can raise primary human relationships to
new and higher levels of richness and creativity. If this should be the
case the loss of this great opportunity would be tragic.</p>

<p>The need of men and women today, as in all ages, is to learn to
live together in love and peace&mdash;to build up rather than to tear
down, to cooperate rather than to compete, to find meaning in life
through open sharing with others rather than through narrow self-seeking.</p>

<p>Religion has always striven to further these goals, because they
represent the spiritual development of man. But again and again the
simple truths spoken by great religious leaders have been lost in the
complexity of elaborate institutions and the lust for power.</p>

<p>Friends have been distinctive in their stubborn resistance to these
diversions and distortions of the simple truth that we must learn to
love God and man, and that there is no other path to redemption. In
each new age, Quakers have found ways to witness to the way of
love and the way of peace.</p>

<p>May it be that a central calling for Friends today is to respond to
the disintegration of marriages and the alienation of the generations
by finding in their own marriages, and in their family relationships, a
new quality of creativeness based on a deep and honest sharing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
life? Can love be spread abroad in the earth, if it cannot be nurtured
in the close and intimate relationship between man and woman, the
nuclear relationship where love begins and where life begins? Can
one proclaim peace among the nations if unable to contrive to live in
harmony with those under one's own roof?</p>

<p>The mood of our age is compounded of hope and despair. We
have achieved so much, in terms of technological skill and power;
and we have achieved so little, in terms of harmonious human
relationships. We have created the power to make this world, compared
with what it has been, a paradise for man to enjoy, but we
have failed to make it possible for man to enjoy what has been
achieved. With the threat of an atomic holocaust hanging like the
sword of Damocles over our heads, we know beyond doubt that we
must learn the art of living together in love and peace or lose all we
have.</p>

<p>In such an hour, what can we do?</p>

<p>We can make a beginning. We can begin at home&mdash;with ourselves,
and those nearest and dearest to us. We can strive to learn the great
art of living in the school that has been provided for us. We can build
relationship-in-depth at the foundations of human society: for in the
last resort the quality of relationships in any community cannot rise
to any higher levels than the quality of relationships in the families
that make up the community; and the quality of relationships in any
family cannot rise any higher than the quality of relationships in the
marriage that has brought it into being.</p>

<p>Yes, there <i>is</i> something we can do to witness to the power of love
and peace. We can make a beginning. Marriage enrichment is such a
beginning.</p>
